# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-09-23

## Current position

- **Phase:** 1 — Tool system, without an LLM
- **Block:** 1.1 — Tool contract
- **State:** Ready to begin
- **Application code:** None
- **Repository state:** Phase 0 complete; Python project and deterministic quality checks reproduce from a clean checkout

## Next action

Before implementing a repository tool, define the common tool contract: identity and description, accepted arguments, success result, controlled errors, repository-boundary enforcement, discovery, and invocation.

## Current constraints

- Keep Phase 1 free of model calls; tool behavior must be deterministic and testable on its own.
- Begin with the three V0.1 repository tools only: `list_files`, `read_file`, and `search_code`.
- Treat repository paths and contents as untrusted input and keep all access read-only and repository-confined.
- Do not choose an agent framework, model provider, retrieval system, or final finding schema yet.
- Keep the evidence-validation question unresolved until Phase 4 so it remains a genuine design exercise.

## Open questions

- What information identifies and describes every tool?
- How are tool arguments and results represented?
- Which errors are part of the tool contract rather than unexpected exceptions?
- How will callers discover and invoke tools without a growing conditional chain?

## Session log

### 2026-09-23 — Phase 0 project setup

- Selected Python 3.12+, `uv`, `uv_build`, and a `src/archagent` package layout.
- Configured Black for formatting, Ruff for linting, mypy in strict mode, and pytest with a package-import smoke test.
- Verified deliberate formatting, linting, and typing failures before applying corrections and confirming passing checks.
- Recreated the project from commit `eef0098` in a temporary clone with `uv sync --locked`; Black, Ruff, mypy, and pytest all passed.
- Completed Phase 0 and advanced to Phase 1, Block 1.1.

### 2026-09-23 — Product and architecture definition

- Completed the V0.1 product definition for one evidence-supported architectural question about a local Python repository.
- Drew and pressure-tested the V0.1 architecture, including loop ownership, run state, failure handling, and read-only repository boundaries.
- Defined Agent, Tool, Model, and Harness responsibilities and traced a file-reading request across their boundaries.
- Advanced to Block 0.4; no application code or tests were added.
- Selected Python 3.12+ to support multiple developer environments, accepting
  the obligation to avoid newer-only features and eventually test supported
  minor versions.

### 2026-09-22 — Planning workspace

- Captured the project purpose, learning philosophy, V0.1 direction, and architecture constraints.
- Created the phased roadmap and Phase 0 workbook.
- Added a persistent AI-collaboration agreement and lightweight ADR process.
- Deliberately made no application architecture or tooling decisions.

## Resume prompt

If useful, begin a future session with:

> Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/STATUS.md`. Begin Phase 1, Block 1.1 from the documented next action. Follow the learning workflow: ask me to define the common repository-tool contract and its tests before implementation, and update project status when we finish.
